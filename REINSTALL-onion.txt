REINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ONION (if the device gets wiped)
1. Log on directly to onion wifi (as when originally configuring), change default root password, and configure to local wifi.
2. Run 'opkg update' and 'opkg install curl'
3. Update /etc/rc.local and crontab with settings listed in README.
4. Modify /etc/rc.button/reset to increase the amount of time you need to hold down the reset button to do a factory reset (i.e. change the line ```elif [ "$SEEN" -gt 5 ]``` to replace the number 5 with whatever number of seconds you're comfortable with]
5. Reboot the onion (to let the new rc.local take effect and start reading/sending stats)
